We live in world full of <strong> appreciation </strong> <br>
somehow other people gets <em> attention </em> and others only get <strong> humiliation </strong> <br>
<br>living a life in this cruel world who's only appreciated are the rich <br>
while we <strong> non-talented </strong> always practice and go to <em> church and preach, </em> <br>
<br>preaching for what? preaching for God to give us blessings and be equal,<br>
but that's not how it works, this is a cruel world full of non-ethical.<br>
equality is just an illusion and we cannot be better if we are <strong> equal. </strong>
