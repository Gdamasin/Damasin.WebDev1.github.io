<h1> Existence is not equal </h1>
<p> 
We live in world full of appreciation
  somehow other people gets attention and others only get humiliation </p>
<p> living a life in this cruel world who's only appreciated are the rich
  while we non-talented always practice and go to church and preach, </p>
<p> preaching for what? preaching for God to give us blessings and be equal,
but that's not how it work, this is a cruel world full of impractical.
equality is just an illusion and we cannot be better if we are equal.
