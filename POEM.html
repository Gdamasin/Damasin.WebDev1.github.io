We live in world full of appreciation <br>
somehow other people gets attention and others only get humiliation <br>
<br>living a life in this cruel world who's only appreciated are the rich <br>
while we non-talented always practice and go to church and preach, <br>
<br>preaching for what? preaching for God to give us blessings and be equal,<br>
but that's not how it works, this is a cruel world full of non-ethical.<br>
equality is just an illusion and we cannot be better if we are equal.
